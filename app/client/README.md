## Code Linting & Formatting

The repository uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

### ESLint

> ESLint is a linting tool for JavaScript. By providing specific configuration defined in the.eslintrc.js file it prevents developers from making silly mistakes in their code and enforces consistency in the codebase.

### Prettier

> This is a great tool for formatting code. It enforces a consistent code style across your entire codebase. By utilizing the "format on save" feature in your IDE you can automatically format the code based on the configuration provided in the .prettierrc file. It will also give you good feedback when something is wrong with the code. If the auto-format doesn't work, something is wrong with the code.

If you are using VSCode, install the following extensions:

-   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

-   [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

You may want to change your VSCode settings to enable auto-formatting on save.
